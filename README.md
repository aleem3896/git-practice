### Response:
According to the article, the quality of data we have collected and stored is apparently very bad. Although I never took the time to consider it directly, I believe this to be the truth. Many forms we fill out do not have input validation, or the input validation they have is not sufficient; the website generally can't dial 555-555-5555 to see if it is a real number, but because it has 10 characters it appears to be so. And whether we like it or not, this is the information that is collected on us users. This might be nice for those who want to protect their true information and keep it off the internet, but this also interferes in the work of data scientists because the data they are trying to work with is skewed, so their results will unfortunately always be off.
